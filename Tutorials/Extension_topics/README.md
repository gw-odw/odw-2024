## Environment

It's recommanded to run the tutorials in a virtual environment of a `conda` environment.
The `IGWN` conda environment is advised: [documentation](https://computing.docs.ligo.org/conda/).
Instructions on setting up your own environment are available [on this page](../../setup.md) (option 3).
You will need just to add via conda the package `nestle = 0.2.0`.

However, it's ok to run all of the tutorials using `pip`.
Currently [Pyhough](https://pypi.org/project/pyhough/) can only be installed from `pip`.
